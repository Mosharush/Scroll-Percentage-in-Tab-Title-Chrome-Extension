## For developers

First get the code and build it:

```
# get the code
`git clone https://github.com/dimshik100/Scroll-Percentage-in-Tab-Title-Chrome-Extension`

# get dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build
```

Now ensure the code loads and works:

* [Load the "dist" folder containing the extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) (or `manifest.json`) in
your browser.

    1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
        The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.
    2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
    3. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory (dist folder).

    4. Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed.

* Load `medium.com` or `dev.to` in your browser and open the developer console.

You should be greeted by a message saying the following

```
Scroll Percentage in Tab Title Extension loaded üëç
```

If that works, you should now be ready to customize the
extension-code. Do this by editing `extension.js`.

Cheers!
